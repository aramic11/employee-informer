# employee-informer

## Description
This application is a way for a user to view all the Departments, Employees and Roles in their company. They are also allowed to add Departments, Employees and Users to the database. In addition, they can update an employee's role if they were to get another position. 

To get the application up and running, you need to install the dependencies by typing npm i into the command line and then you will need to install MySQL by typing npm install mysql into the command line. Once that is completed, you just have to type node server.js to begin the application. 

This project helped me learn more about databases and the differences between primary and foreign keys to make sure it would connect properly. I've also used a function which always the user to switch between different options which was very useful to learn. In all it further solidifed my understanding in databases and I hope to continue learning more.
